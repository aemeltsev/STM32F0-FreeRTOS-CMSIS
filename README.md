# STM32F0-FreeRTOS-CMSIS
=============================================================

The template project for a quick start with STM32 microcontroller using CMSIS and FReeRTOS. Note: This project forked from this repo - https://github.com/WoodyWoodsta/STM32F0-freeRTOS-CMSIS.

Project features:
* Template firmware for STM32F0 microcontroller
* Tested on STM32F0Discovery (STM32F051R8) and STM32F030C6 "Blue pill"
* Makefile build from console and VSCode
* CMSIS v4.1 - http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php
* FreeRTOS v7.6 integrated with CMSIS-RTOS from STM32Cube
* OpenOCD instant flash support with `make flash`
* Works great with VSCode debug via GDB
